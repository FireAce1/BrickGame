Steps to creat a simple Brick Game Project
Create a new Java project and a Main class where the game will start.
Create a GameFrame class to set up the game window.
The GamePanel class is where the game's logic will be implemented
Create a Paddle class to manage the player's paddle.
Create a Ball class to manage the ball’s movement.
Create a Brick class to represent each brick
Add instances of Paddle, Ball, and an array of Brick objects in the GamePanel.
Implement logic to draw these components and handle their interactions.
Add key listeners to move the paddle left and right.
Implement logic to detect collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks. Adjust the ball’s direction upon collision.
Add logic to handle when all bricks are destroyed (win) or when the ball goes below the paddle (lose).
Add features like levels, scoring, and sound effects.
Optimize code, add comments, and refactor as needed.
